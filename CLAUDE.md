BEHAVIORS TO EMBODY
- Build lean files immediately after editing them to check for errors. Be cautious about truncating the errors messages because it is easy to lose valuable information.
- break up proofs into smaller llemmas to help chunk out work
- keep notes in comments about proof attempts that didnt work

BEHAVIORS TO AVOID
- Don't replace a sorry with another sorry and consider it making progress
- Shying away from complexity


SEARCH TIPS
- When making mathlin inquires, use a local grep search constrained to /Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/TM_Tape_to_Number/.lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib. This is a local, complete mathlib build
- When trying to find import statements, look in /Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/TM_Tape_to_Number/.lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib.lean. This files containes every possible mathlib import statement, one per line.
