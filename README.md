# TM Tape to Number: Formalizing Turing Machine Integer Sequences

A formal verification project in Lean 4 that formalizes Turing machines generating integer sequences through tape content encoding. Instead of studying what Turing machines *compute*, we study the *sequences of numbers* they generate by encoding their tape contents at each computation step.

### The Core Idea

**Traditional View**: Turing machines are studied for their computational outputs - what final result they produce.

**Our Approach**: We encode the *entire tape content* as a natural number at each step, creating an integer sequence that captures the machine's evolving internal state.

### Key Innovation: Absolute Position Encoding

We implement a **leftward-unbounded tape model** where:
- The tape head is constrained to positions ≤ 0 (positions 0, -1, -2, -3, ...)
- Tape positions have **absolute coordinates** that never change, regardless of head movement
- Each position contributes to the encoding based on its absolute coordinate:
  - Position 0 → contributes 2⁰ = 1 (ones place)
  - Position -1 → contributes 2¹ = 2 (twos place)  
  - Position -2 → contributes 2² = 4 (fours place)
  - And so on...

This creates a **binary encoding** where the tape content directly maps to a natural number, independent of the machine's execution state.

### Example: Powers of Two Machine

Consider a machine that:
1. Writes `true` at position 0, then moves left
2. Finds the leftmost `true`, moves left once more, writes `true`
3. Repeats this process

**Tape Evolution**:
```
Step 0: [T] at position 0           → Encoding: 1
Step 1: [T][T] at positions -1,0    → Encoding: 3  
Step 2: [T][T][T] at positions -2,-1,0 → Encoding: 7
```

**Generated Sequence**: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ... (numbers of form 2ⁿ - 1)

### Module Overview

#### **LeftTM0/** - Core Infrastructure
- **`LeftwardTape.lean`**: Implements tape constrained to positions ≤ 0
  - Absolute position tracking independent of head movement
  - Move operations that respect the leftward constraint
  - Finite support guarantees for encoding

- **`Machine.lean`**: Defines machine types and configurations
  - Standard TM0 machine extended with position constraints
  - Configuration type combining state and constrained tape

- **`Step.lean`**: Execution semantics preserving constraints
  - Step function that halts if constraint would be violated
  - Multi-step execution and termination detection

#### **LeftwardEncoding/** - Tape → Number Encoding
- **`Basic.lean`**: Core encoding functionality
  - `encode: LeftwardTape Bool → ℕ` - converts tape to natural number
  - Encoding based on absolute positions of `true` values
  - Step-wise encoding difference bounds

- **`Properties.lean`**: Mathematical properties of encoding
  - Encoding bounds based on leftmost true position
  - Invariance under head movements
  - Injectivity and determinism results

#### **LeftwardSequences/** - Sequence Generation  
- **`Basic.lean`**: Sequence generation from machine execution
  - `sequence: Machine → Config → ℕ → ℕ` - generates integer sequences
  - Bounded execution and termination handling

- **`Theorems.lean`**: Growth bounds and convergence properties
  - Exponential growth bounds based on reachable positions
  - Sequence stability when machines halt

##  Mathematical Results

### Core Theorems

1. **Encoding Bounds**: If all positions left of `-n` are false, then `encode(tape) < 2^(n+1)`

2. **Step Difference Bounds**: Any single machine step changes the encoding by at most `2^k` for some `k`

3. **Sequence Growth**: Generated sequences have exponential growth bounds based on initial tape content

4. **Movement Invariance**: Head movements don't change the encoding (only writes do)

### Applications

This framework enables:
- **Sequence Classification**: Categorizing integer sequences by their generating machines
- **Computational Complexity**: Studying growth rates of mechanically generated sequences  
- **Algorithmic Information**: Connecting tape complexity to sequence properties
