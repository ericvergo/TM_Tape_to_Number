# TM Tape to Number: Formalizing Turing Machine Integer Sequences

A formal verification project in Lean 4 that proves fundamental results about integer sequences generated by Turing machines through tape content encoding. This work formalizes the paper "Integer Sequences from Turing Machine Tapes" and establishes a complete characterization of mechanically-generated sequences.

## 🌟 Major Results Formalized

### 1. **Binary Step Sequences Characterization**
We prove that the class of sequences generated by Turing machines is exactly the class of **binary step sequences** - sequences where consecutive differences are 0 or ±2^k with specific movement constraints.

### 2. **Tight Growth Bounds**
Every TM-generated sequence satisfies the exponential bound: `s_t < 2^(t+1)` for all time steps t.

### 3. **Constructive Generation Theorem**
Every finite binary step sequence can be generated by some Turing machine (constructive proof).

## 📐 Mathematical Framework

### Core Encoding System

We use a **leftward-unbounded tape model** with absolute position encoding:
- Tape positions: ..., -3, -2, -1, 0 (head constrained to positions ≤ 0)
- Each position contributes based on its absolute coordinate:
  - Position 0 → 2⁰ = 1
  - Position -1 → 2¹ = 2  
  - Position -2 → 2² = 4
  - And so on...

**Encoding formula**: `encode(tape) = ∑ i ∈ true_positions, 2^|i|`

### Binary Step Sequences

A sequence s : ℕ → ℕ is a **binary step sequence** if:
1. s₀ = 0
2. For each t, the difference s_{t+1} - s_t ∈ {0, ±2^k}
3. Movement constraints:
   - k_t ≤ t (reachability bound)
   - |k_j - k_i| ≤ j - i for i < j (movement bound)

## 🚀 Example: Powers of Two Machine

A simple machine that generates 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ... (numbers of form 2ⁿ - 1):

```
Step 0: [T] at position 0              → 2⁰ = 1
Step 1: [T][T] at positions -1,0       → 2⁰ + 2¹ = 3  
Step 2: [T][T][T] at positions -2,-1,0 → 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2² = 7
```

The machine repeatedly:
1. Finds the leftmost `true`
2. Moves one position left
3. Writes `true`
