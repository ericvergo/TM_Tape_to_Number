# Blueprint Creation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Blueprint Infrastructure Setup
- Installed `leanblueprint` Python package with dependencies
- Configured blueprint directory structure in `blueprint/src/`
- Created LaTeX files for web and print versions

### 2. Content Conversion
- Converted the existing paper "Integer Sequences from Turing Machine Tapes" to blueprint format
- Added Lean linking annotations:
  - `\lean{}` commands linking to Lean declarations
  - `\leanok` for fully formalized results (with complete proofs)
  - `\notready` for results with incomplete proofs (containing `sorry`)
  - `\uses{}` for dependency tracking

### 3. Dependency Graph Structure
The blueprint creates an interactive dependency graph centered on `finite_binary_step_sequence_generable`:

**Main Theorem Path:**
```
encoding (def) → binary_step_sequence (def) → forward_characterization (thm)
                                           ↘
                                             finite_sequence_generation (thm)
                                           ↗
construct_tm (def) ———————————————————————→
```

**Supporting Lemma Chain:**
```
encode_diff_at_write → sequence_diff_is_power_of_two → sequence_k_equals_position
                                                      ↘
                                                        sequence_k_bound
                                                      ↘
                                                        sequence_k_movement_constraint
```

### 4. Status Indicators
- **Green border + green background**: Fully formalized (definition + proof)
- **Green border + white background**: Statement formalized, proof incomplete
- **Orange border**: Not ready for formalization

### 5. GitHub Integration
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automatic building and deployment
- Blueprint will be hosted at: https://ericvergo.github.io/TM_Tape_to_Number
- Automatic rebuilding on push to main branch

### 6. Features Implemented
- Interactive dependency visualization using D3.js and Graphviz
- Click on nodes to see theorem statements
- Links to both LaTeX source and Lean documentation
- Responsive design with collapsible legend
- Integration with Lean declaration checking

## Current Status
- 2 definitions fully formalized (green)
- 1 theorem statement formalized (forward characterization)
- 8 results with incomplete proofs (marked with `\notready`)
- Main theorem `finite_binary_step_sequence_generable` has dependencies clearly mapped

## Next Steps
1. Push to GitHub to trigger automatic deployment
2. Complete the proofs marked with `sorry` in the Lean code
3. Update blueprint status indicators as proofs are completed
4. Consider adding more detailed proof sketches in the blueprint

## Viewing the Blueprint
- **Locally**: Run `leanblueprint serve` in project root, visit http://localhost:8000
- **Online**: Once deployed, visit https://ericvergo.github.io/TM_Tape_to_Number
