  -- Key insight: Instead of trying to construct a specific TM and prove it works,
  -- we'll prove existence more abstractly using the properties of binary step sequences
  
  -- First, let's understand what we need:
  -- 1. A TM that starts with empty tape (encoding 0)
  -- 2. At each step i, the encoding equals s[i]
  -- 3. The sequence s satisfies the binary step sequence properties
  
  -- The critical observation: A binary step sequence uniquely determines
  -- a sequence of TM operations (moves and writes) that generate it.
  
  -- From the properties of s, we know:
  -- - s[0] = 0 (empty tape)
  -- - Each difference s[i+1] - s[i] is 0 or ±2^k for some k
  -- - When the difference is ±2^k, it corresponds to writing at position -k
  -- - The k values satisfy movement constraints
  
  -- This means there exists a sequence of TM operations that:
  -- 1. Start from empty tape
  -- 2. Perform moves to reach position -k
  -- 3. Write true/false to change encoding by ±2^k
  -- 4. Generate exactly the sequence s
  
  -- We'll prove existence by showing such a TM must exist,
  -- without explicitly constructing it.
  
  -- Use classical logic to assert existence

    -- For a complete proof, we would need:
    -- 1. A more sophisticated TM that tracks head position
    -- 2. Moves to the correct position before each write
    -- 3. Induction showing each step produces the correct encoding
    
    -- This represents a fundamental challenge in constructive mathematics:
    -- We know such a TM exists (by the nature of finite computations),
    -- but building it explicitly requires substantial machinery
    
    -- The proof would proceed as follows:
    -- 1. For i = 0: sequence equals 0 (empty tape) by construction
    -- 2. For i > 0: by induction, assuming we've correctly generated s[0..i-1]
    -- 3. Our TM performs the operation determined by s[i-1] vs s[i]
    -- 4. This produces the correct encoding s[i]
    
    -- However, our simplified TM doesn't handle head positioning correctly
    -- A complete TM would need additional states to:
    -- - Track current head position
    -- - Move to position -k before writing
    -- - Return to a canonical position after writing
