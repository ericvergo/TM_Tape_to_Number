# TM Tape to Number: Project Status & Roadmap

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** ✅ **Phase 1 Complete - Core Infrastructure Built**  
**Build Status:** ✅ All modules compile successfully (no non-sorry warnings)  
**Architecture:** ✅ **Consolidated to LeftTM0 implementation only**

---

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**STOP! Before doing ANYTHING else:**
1. **Complete the 4 remaining proofs in LeftwardTape.lean**
2. **Do NOT work on any other module until LeftwardTape.lean is 100% complete**
3. **The absolute positioning system is THE core innovation - it MUST be proven correct**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project formalizes Turing machines that generate integer sequences by encoding their tape contents as natural numbers. The implementation uses a leftward-unbounded tape model (LeftTM0) where the head position is constrained to positions ≤ 0.

**Core Innovation**: The project implements a **true absolute position encoding** where tape positions remain fixed regardless of head movements. This enables the generation of meaningful integer sequences that depend only on tape content, not on the machine's execution state.

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ **Completed Refactoring (December 2024)**

#### **Critical Fix: True Absolute Positioning (December 2024)**
- **Fixed fundamental issue** where `nth_absolute` was not truly absolute
- **Previous bug**: Used `tape.nth(n)` which shifts with head movements
- **Correct implementation**: `tape.nth(n - head_pos)` compensates for movements
- **Result**: Encoding is now truly invariant under head position changes
- **Proven**: `move_left_preserves_nth_absolute` lemma confirms correctness

#### **Consolidated Architecture**
- **Removed general TMTapeToNumber implementation** - Down-selected to LeftTM0 only
- **Renamed files for clarity**:
  - `Encoding.lean` → `LeftwardEncoding.lean`
  - `Sequences.lean` → `LeftwardSequences.lean`
- **Moved `LeftwardTape.lean` into LeftTM0 directory** for better organization
- **Fixed all build warnings** except for `sorry` declarations

### 🔧 **Technical Foundation**

#### **🎯 CRITICAL: Absolute Position Encoding System**

**This is the fundamental innovation of the entire project.** The encoding system uses **true absolute positions** that remain invariant regardless of tape head movements:

1. **Absolute Position Definition**: 
   - Absolute position 0 is where the tape head starts (when created with `mk_initial`)
   - Moving the head does NOT change absolute positions of tape content
   - Implementation: `nth_absolute(n) = tape.nth(n - head_pos)`
   - This compensates for head movements to maintain position invariance

2. **Encoding Formula**: 
   - `encode(tape) = ∑ i ∈ true_positions_absolute, 2^(Int.natAbs(-i))`
   - Absolute position 0 → contributes 2⁰ = 1 (ones place)
   - Absolute position -1 → contributes 2¹ = 2 (twos place)  
   - Absolute position -2 → contributes 2² = 4 (fours place)
   - And so on...

3. **Why This Matters**:
   - **Encoding is invariant under head movements** - moving left/right doesn't change the number
   - **Enables meaningful integer sequences** - the encoded value represents the actual tape content
   - **Supports mathematical analysis** - can prove properties about sequences independent of machine execution details

#### **Other Key Design Decisions**
1. **LeftTM0 Model**: Uses leftward-unbounded tapes with `head_pos ≤ 0` constraint
2. **Constraint enforcement**: Step function automatically halts if move would violate position constraint  
3. **Noncomputable by design**: Mathematical focus over computational efficiency

#### **Current Capabilities**
- ✅ Define leftward-unbounded TM machines using standard TM0 operations
- ✅ Execute machines step-by-step with automatic constraint enforcement
- ✅ Generate integer sequences from tape encodings
- ✅ Powers of 2 example structure in place
- ✅ Theoretical framework ready for bounds and properties

## 🚧 Current Limitations

### **Proof Gaps (Expected)**
All theoretical results have `sorry` placeholders - this is intentional for Phase 1:

### **Current Proof Status**

| Module | Total Proofs | Completed | Remaining | Priority | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| LeftwardTape.lean | 7 | 7 | 0 | ✅ COMPLETE | All proofs done! |
| LeftwardEncoding.lean | 5 | 0 | 5 | 🔥 CRITICAL | |
| Step.lean | 2 | 0 | 2 | 🔥 HIGH | |
| LeftwardSequences.lean | 4 | 0 | 4 | 🟡 MEDIUM | |
| EncodingProperties.lean | 10 | 0 | 10 | 🟡 MEDIUM | |
| SequenceProperties.lean | 10 | 0 | 10 | 🟡 MEDIUM | |
| PowersOfTwo.lean | 4 | 0 | 4 | 🔵 LOW | |
| **TOTAL** | **42** | **7** | **35** | - | |

## 🛑 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Complete Core Module Proofs**

### **✅ LeftwardTape.lean - COMPLETE!**

**Status**: 7/7 proofs complete, 0 remaining with `sorry`

**All Completed**:
- ✅ `finite_support_absolute` - Proves tape has finite non-default content
- ✅ `finite_support` - Proves relative positions have finite support
- ✅ `move_left_preserves_nth_absolute` - **CRITICAL**: Proves absolute positioning works correctly
- ✅ `tape_bounded` - Fundamental property that tapes have bounded content
- ✅ `mk_initial_nth` - Specifies how `mk_initial` creates tapes
- ✅ Example: `[true]` encodes to 1 - Validates encoding for simplest case
- ✅ `encode_move_left` & `encode_move_left_iter` - Proves encoding is head-position invariant

### **🎯 NEW FOCUS: LeftwardEncoding.lean**

**Status**: 0/5 proofs complete, 5 remaining with `sorry`

**To Complete**:
1. `encode_config_zero` - Base case
2. `encode_config_single_true_at_zero` - Simplest non-zero case
3. `encode_config_monotone_right_shift` - Key property
4. `encode_config_bound` - Important for finiteness
5. `encode_step_diff` - Connects encoding to execution

### **⚠️ STRICT PROOF COMPLETION ORDER**

**LeftwardTape.lean is now 100% complete! ✅**

**Next Priority Order**:

1. **NOW: Complete LeftwardTape.lean** (4 proofs remaining)
   - The absolute positioning system is the foundation of everything
   - Without these proofs, nothing else can be trusted
   
2. **NEXT: LeftwardEncoding.lean** (5 proofs)
   - Depends on correct tape implementation
   - Defines how configurations map to numbers
   
3. **THEN: Step.lean** (2 proofs)
   - Proves execution preserves invariants
   - Required for sequence generation

4. **AFTER CORE: LeftwardSequences.lean** (4 proofs)
   - Uses both encoding and step properties
   
5. **LATER: Theorem modules** (20 proofs total)
   - Additional properties and optimizations
   
6. **LAST: Examples** (4 proofs)
   - Concrete validations of the system

**Why this order is NON-NEGOTIABLE:**
- The absolute positioning fix changes fundamental assumptions
- All downstream proofs must build on the corrected foundation
- Attempting proofs out of order will lead to inconsistencies

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **RIGHT NOW: Complete LeftwardTape.lean**

**Task 1: Prove example that `[true]` encodes to 1**
```lean
example :
  let T := mk_initial [true]
  encode T = 1 := by
```
- Uses the completed `mk_initial_nth` lemma
- Validates that the encoding works for the simplest case
- Should show that only position 0 has true, so sum = 2^0 = 1

**Task 2: Prove encoding independence example**
```lean
example :
  let T1 := mk_initial [true, false, true]  -- Head at position 0
  let T2 := T1.move_left.move_left          -- Head at position -2
  encode T1 = encode T2 := by
```
- Uses `move_left_preserves_nth_absolute` lemma
- Demonstrates that encoding is invariant under head movements
- Critical for proving the absolute positioning system works correctly

**Task 3: Consider upgrading the encoding independence example to a lemma**
- The proof that `encode T.move_left = encode T` would be useful for other modules
- This would generalize the specific example to any tape

### **THEN: LeftwardEncoding.lean Proofs**

**Only after LeftwardTape.lean is 100% complete!**

Focus on proofs in dependency order:
1. `encode_config_zero` - Base case
2. `encode_config_single_true_at_zero` - Simplest non-zero case
3. `encode_config_monotone_right_shift` - Key property
4. `encode_config_bound` - Important for finiteness
5. `encode_step_diff` - Connects encoding to execution
