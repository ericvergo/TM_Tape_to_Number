### **Remaining Sorries** 🔧
Total: **14 sorries** (down from 22)

1. **EncodingDifference.lean** (3 sorries):
   - `encode_diff_at_write`: Prove writing changes encoding by 0 or ±2^k
   - `encode_strict_decrease_write_false`: Prove writing false decreases encoding
   - `encode_strict_increase_write_true`: Prove writing true increases encoding

2. **EncodingProperties.lean** (4 sorries):
   - `encode_diff_zero_implies_same`: Prove diff=0 implies writing same value
   - `encode_nat_sub_zero_eq`: Prove natural subtraction properties
   - `encode_same_value_zero_diff`: Prove same value gives zero diff
   - `encode_diff_at_write_simple`: Simplified version of main lemma

3. **SequenceProperties.lean** (4 sorries):
   - `sequence_diff_is_power_of_two`: Prove sequence changes by 0 or ±2^k
   - `encode_change_from_step`: Helper for sequence diff proof
   - `sequence_k_equals_position`: Prove k equals absolute position
   - `sequence_k_movement_constraint`: Prove movement bounds on k

4. **Theorems.lean** (3 sorries):
   - 2 auxiliary lemmas: Prove sequence change implies machine hasn't terminated
   - `finite_binary_step_sequence_generable`: Main constructive proof

### **Key Improvements Made**

1. **Natural Subtraction Refactoring**:
   - Added `encode_diff` function for integer differences
   - Fixed all lemmas that incorrectly said "diff = 0" when encoding decreased
   - Ensures mathematical correctness throughout

2. **Module Organization**:
   - Split monolithic Lemmas.lean into focused files
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easier to understand and maintain

3. **Statement Verification**:
   - Reviewed all unproved lemmas
   - Fixed parameter issues
   - Ensured type consistency
   - Ready for proof completion without modifications

## 🔮 **Next Steps**

### **Proof Completion Priority**

1. **High Priority - Core Encoding Proofs**:
   - Complete `encode_diff_at_write` and related lemmas
   - These are fundamental to the entire theory

2. **Medium Priority - Sequence Properties**:
   - Prove sequence difference properties
   - Build on encoding proofs

3. **Low Priority - Constructive Proof**:
   - Complete `finite_binary_step_sequence_generable`
   - This is the reverse direction theorem

### **Technical Approach**

For each remaining sorry:
1. Use MCP tools to understand proof state
2. Apply appropriate tactics
3. Leverage completed lemmas
4. Verify with `lake build`

The codebase is now in excellent shape for systematic proof completion.
