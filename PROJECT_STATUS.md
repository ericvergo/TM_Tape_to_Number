## 📊 **Proof Status Summary**

### **Completed Proofs** ✅

## 🔮 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **Complete encoding lemmas**:
   - Fix trivial arithmetic in `encode_diff_at_write`: `(a + b) - a = b`
   - This will fully unlock `sequence_diff_is_power_of_two`

2. **Build on completed foundation**:
   - Complete `sequence_diff_is_power_of_two` using the proven `encode_diff_at_write`
   - Complete the three `sequence_k_*` lemmas using head position properties
   - These support the growth bound proof

### **Technical Details Needed** 🔧
- Simple arithmetic lemma for cast normalization: `↑(a + b) - ↑a = ↑b` 
- Relationship between `steps` function and `step_or_stay` for transition analysis
- Properties of `Int.natAbs` for negative head positions in bounds proofs
- TM construction algorithm for finite sequence generation

- Optimize sequence computation for large time steps
- Prepare formalization for publication
- Consider mechanizing related results about TM sequences
