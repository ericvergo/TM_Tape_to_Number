# TM Tape to Number: Project Status & Roadmap

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** 🚀 **Phase 2 Active - Final Proofs Remaining**  
**Build Status:** ✅ All modules compile successfully with 3 sorries  
**Architecture:** ✅ **Refactored file structure - LeftTM0 implementation only**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project formalizes Turing machines that generate integer sequences by encoding their tape contents as natural numbers. The implementation uses a leftward-unbounded tape model (LeftTM0) where the head position is constrained to positions ≤ 0.

**Core Innovation**: The project implements a **true absolute position encoding** where tape positions remain fixed regardless of head movements. This enables the generation of meaningful integer sequences that depend only on tape content, not on the machine's execution state.

### 🔧 **Technical Foundation**

#### **Absolute Position Encoding System**

1. **Encoding Formula**: 
   - `encode(tape) = ∑ i ∈ true_positions_absolute, 2^(Int.natAbs(-i))`
   - Absolute position 0 → contributes 2⁰ = 1
   - Absolute position -1 → contributes 2¹ = 2  
   - Absolute position -2 → contributes 2² = 4
   - And so on...

2. **Key Properties**:
   - Encoding is invariant under head movements
   - Single TM step changes encoding by at most 2^k
   - Encoding bounded by leftmost true position

### **Remaining Proofs (3 sorries total)**

#### 🔴 **Critical Proof (1 sorry)**

**`encode_step_diff` write case (LeftwardEncoding/Basic.lean:212)**
- Status: 🔴 **BLOCKS** `sequence_step_difference_bound`
- Location: Line 212 - sorry in the write case
- Task: Prove that writing changes encoding by at most 2^|head_pos|
- Current approach: Need to show all 4 cases (read true/false × write true/false)
- Difficulty: **MEDIUM** - Requires careful case analysis with Tape.write_nth

#### 🟡 **Tape Evolution Proofs (2 sorries)**

**`sequence_bounded_growth` tape evolution bounds (LeftwardSequences/Theorems.lean:87, 114)**
- Status: 🟡 Two sorries for the two cases (leftmost_true_pos = none/some)
- Location: Lines 87 and 114 in the match cases
- Task: Prove that positions beyond head reach remain false after t steps
- Key insight: Head can move at most t positions left in t steps
- Difficulty: **MEDIUM** - Requires inductive proof about head movement bounds
- Approach: Need helper lemma showing unreachable positions remain unchanged

**`sequence_step_difference_bound` (LeftwardSequences/Theorems.lean)**
- Status: ✅ **COMPLETE** (but depends on encode_step_diff)
- Task: None - proof structure is complete
- Note: Will work once encode_step_diff is proven

## 🎯 Explicit Completion Plan

### **Phase 1: Complete `encode_step_diff` write case**

**File**: `/Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/TM_Tape_to_Number/TMTapeToNumber/LeftwardEncoding/Basic.lean`  
**Line**: 208  
**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Blocks sequence_step_difference_bound

**Current State**: Simplified to a single sorry after setting up the framework

**Completion Strategy**:
1. Need to prove for all 4 cases: (read true/false) × (write true/false)
2. Cases where read = write: encoding unchanged (difference = 0)
3. Cases where read ≠ write: encoding changes by exactly 2^|head_pos|
4. Key challenge: Properly handling the `Tape.write_nth` theorem and Bool case analysis

### **Phase 2: Complete `sequence_bounded_growth` tape evolution**

**File**: `/Users/eric/Documents/GitHub/TM_Tape_to_Number/TMTapeToNumber/LeftwardSequences/Theorems.lean`  
**Lines**: 35 and 56 (two sorries in match cases)  
**Priority**: 🟡 **HIGH** - Main theorem completion

**Current State**: Two sorries, one for each case of leftmost_true_pos

**Key Insight**: Positions beyond head's reach remain unchanged during execution

**Completion Strategy**:
1. Extract common lemma: `unreachable_positions_unchanged`
   - Prove by induction on number of steps
   - Show head can move at most 1 position left per step
2. For `none` case: Show all positions ≤ 0 initially false
3. For `some pos` case: Use definition of leftmost_true_pos
4. Apply unreachable positions lemma to both cases

### **Phase 3: Final Integration and Verification**

**Deliverables**:
1. **Zero sorries**: Complete all 3 remaining proof gaps
2. **Clean build**: `lake build` with no warnings
3. **Updated status**: Reflect 100% completion in PROJECT_STATUS.md

**Success Criteria**:
- Both main theorems fully proven:
  - `sequence_step_difference_bound`: Consecutive values differ by ≤ 2^k
  - `sequence_bounded_growth`: Values bounded by initial leftmost position
- Ready for Phase 3: Example verification and documentation

## 📈 Progress Metrics

- **Initial State**: 39 proofs with `sorry`
- **After Pruning**: 7 essential proofs
- **Current State**: 3 sorries remaining in 2 theorems
- **Completion Rate**: 88% (22/25 total proofs complete)
- **Recent Progress**: Simplified proof structure for remaining theorems

## 🎯 **Current Status: 3 sorries in final 2 theorems - Phase 2 nearly complete!**

**Session Achievement**: Successfully restructured the remaining proofs:
1. **Simplified `encode_step_diff`**: Reduced to a single sorry for the write case
2. **Documented proof strategies**: All sorries now have clear approaches documented
3. **Build success**: Project compiles successfully with only 3 remaining sorries

**Remaining Work**:
- 1 sorry in `encode_step_diff` (write case - need to handle Tape.write_nth)
- 2 sorries in `sequence_bounded_growth` (tape evolution bounds)

**Technical Challenges**:
- Need to properly import/use `Tape.write_nth` theorem from mathlib
- Require helper lemmas for head movement bounds and unreachable positions

**Next Steps**: 
1. Complete the write case proof using proper Bool case analysis
2. Prove tape evolution bounds with inductive argument on steps
3. Move to Phase 3: Example verification and documentation
