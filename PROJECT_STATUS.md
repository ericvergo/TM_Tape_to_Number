# TM Tape to Number: Project Status & Roadmap

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** ✅ **Phase 1 Complete - Core Infrastructure Built**  
**Build Status:** ✅ All modules compile successfully (no non-sorry warnings)  
**Architecture:** ✅ **Consolidated to LeftTM0 implementation only**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project formalizes Turing machines that generate integer sequences by encoding their tape contents as natural numbers. The implementation uses a leftward-unbounded tape model (LeftTM0) where the head position is constrained to positions ≤ 0.

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ **Completed Refactoring (December 2024)**

#### **Consolidated Architecture**
- **Removed general TMTapeToNumber implementation** - Down-selected to LeftTM0 only
- **Renamed files for clarity**:
  - `Encoding.lean` → `LeftwardEncoding.lean`
  - `Sequences.lean` → `LeftwardSequences.lean`
- **Moved `LeftwardTape.lean` into LeftTM0 directory** for better organization
- **Fixed all build warnings** except for `sorry` declarations

#### **Current Structure**

```

### 🔧 **Technical Foundation**

#### **Key Design Decisions**
1. **LeftTM0 Model**: Uses leftward-unbounded tapes with `head_pos ≤ 0` constraint
2. **Absolute position encoding**: Position 0 → 2⁰, position -1 → 2¹, position -2 → 2², etc.
3. **Constraint enforcement**: Step function automatically halts if move would violate position constraint
4. **Encoding formula**: `∑ i ∈ true_positions_absolute, 2^(Int.natAbs (-i))`
5. **Noncomputable by design**: Mathematical focus over computational efficiency

#### **Current Capabilities**
- ✅ Define leftward-unbounded TM machines using standard TM0 operations
- ✅ Execute machines step-by-step with automatic constraint enforcement
- ✅ Generate integer sequences from tape encodings
- ✅ Powers of 2 example structure in place
- ✅ Theoretical framework ready for bounds and properties

## 🚧 Current Limitations

### **Proof Gaps (Expected)**
All theoretical results have `sorry` placeholders - this is intentional for Phase 1:

### **Current Proof Status**

| Module | Total Proofs | Completed | Remaining | Priority |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| LeftwardTape.lean | 4 | 0 | 4 | 🔥 CRITICAL |
| LeftwardEncoding.lean | 5 | 0 | 5 | 🔥 CRITICAL |
| Step.lean | 2 | 0 | 2 | 🔥 HIGH |
| LeftwardSequences.lean | 4 | 0 | 4 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| EncodingProperties.lean | 10 | 0 | 10 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| SequenceProperties.lean | 10 | 0 | 10 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| PowersOfTwo.lean | 4 | 0 | 4 | 🔵 LOW |
| **TOTAL** | **39** | **0** | **39** | - |

## 🛑 **CRITICAL: Proof Completion Order**

### **⚠️ MUST COMPLETE IN THIS ORDER:**

1. **FIRST: Core Module Proofs** (LeftwardTape.lean, LeftwardEncoding.lean)
   - These define the fundamental encoding and its properties
   - All other proofs depend on these being correct
   - DO NOT skip to sequences or examples

2. **SECOND: Step Module Proofs** (Step.lean)
   - These establish how machines execute
   - Required before proving anything about sequences

3. **THIRD: Sequence Module Proofs** (LeftwardSequences.lean)
   - These depend on both encoding and step properties
   - Required before verifying any examples

4. **THEN: Theorem Module Proofs** (EncodingProperties.lean, SequenceProperties.lean)
   - These provide additional properties and lemmas
   - Build on the core proofs

5. **ONLY THEN: Example Proofs** (PowersOfTwo.lean, etc.)
   - These rely on all core infrastructure proofs
   - Will be impossible to prove correctly without the foundation

**Why this order is mandatory:**
- Later proofs reference earlier ones
- Skipping ahead leads to circular dependencies
- Core proofs establish the invariants that everything else assumes

## 🎯 Next Steps & Roadmap

### **Phase 2: Core Proofs (Week 1)**

#### **Priority 1: LeftwardTape.lean**
```lean
theorem finite_support_absolute  -- Proves tape has finite support
theorem finite_support          -- Compatibility theorem
example (encoding = 1)          -- Basic encoding example
example (encoding independent)  -- Position independence example
```

#### **Priority 2: LeftwardEncoding.lean**
```lean
theorem encode_config_zero
theorem encode_config_single_true_at_zero
theorem encode_config_monotone_right_shift
theorem encode_config_bound
theorem encode_step_diff
```

#### **Priority 3: Step.lean**
```lean
theorem step_preserves_position_constraint
theorem steps_preserves_position_constraint
```

### **Phase 3: Sequence and Theorem Proofs (Week 2)**

Only start after core module proofs are complete.

### **Phase 4: Example Verification (Week 3+)**

Do NOT start until all core and theorem proofs are complete.

## 📋 Implementation Guidelines

### **Proof Development Strategy**

1. **Start with simple cases**: Prove for empty tapes, single elements
2. **Build helper lemmas**: Create intermediate results as needed
3. **Use mathlib tactics**: Leverage existing theorems about `Finset`, `Function.iterate`, etc.
4. **Test incrementally**: Ensure each proof compiles before moving on

### **Code Quality Standards**

- Every theorem must compile without errors
- Use descriptive names for helper lemmas
- Add comments for complex proof steps
- Keep proofs readable and maintainable
