# Review of Unproved Statements

## Summary

All unproved statements have been reviewed and corrected where necessary. The codebase is now ready for future work to focus exclusively on clearing sorries without worrying about correctness issues.

## Changes Made During Review

### EncodingDifference.lean
1. **Fixed**: Removed unused parameter `a` from `encode_strict_decrease_write_false` and `encode_strict_increase_write_true`
2. **Verified**: `encode_diff_at_write` correctly uses integer differences

### EncodingProperties.lean  
1. **Fixed**: Changed `encode_diff_at_write_inl_implies_same` to `encode_diff_zero_implies_same` using integer differences
2. **Fixed**: Updated proof sketch to use integer differences correctly
3. **Fixed**: Changed `encode_same_value_zero_diff` to return integer difference = 0
4. **Fixed**: Simplified `encode_nat_diff_zero_cases` to just state the inequality property
5. **Verified**: `encode_diff_at_write_simple` and `encode_write_diff_value` correctly use integer differences

### SequenceProperties.lean
All lemmas verified as correctly formulated:
- `sequence_diff_is_power_of_two`
- `encode_change_from_step`
- `sequence_k_equals_position`
- `sequence_k_movement_constraint`

### Theorems.lean
- Two auxiliary sorries for proving "if sequence changes, machine hasn't terminated" - these are valid lemmas that need proof
- One main sorry in `finite_binary_step_sequence_generable` - the theorem statement is correct but needs a constructive proof

## Current Sorry Count

After review and fixes:
- EncodingDifference.lean: 3 sorries
- EncodingProperties.lean: 4 sorries (reduced from 6)
- SequenceProperties.lean: 4 sorries  
- Theorems.lean: 3 sorries (2 auxiliary + 1 main theorem)

Total: 14 sorries remaining

## Verification

All statements are now:
1. Mathematically correct
2. Using appropriate types (integer differences where needed)
3. Free of unused parameters
4. Properly handling natural subtraction edge cases
5. Ready for proof completion without further modifications
